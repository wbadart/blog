Welcome back to the Coffee Log. Today, we'll be looking at the
*Ethiopian Moka Java*, part of World Market's Direct Trade Coffee
Sampler.

<!-- MORE -->

The Moka Java is a medium/ light roast Arabica bean, described as
having "bright citrus notes and a mellow, spice-laced body." The brew
itself is a little hazy (could just be the fine grounds; the coffee
came ground), and when you lift the mug to your face, that tangy
citrus element is the first thing you'll notice.

In terms of flavor, this coffee has low to medium acidity and
bitterness, just enough to make it interesting in my opinion, but
probably too much for someone who's looking for an easy-to-down
crowd-pleaser. I can't say I found the "spiced" element of the
description to be all to strong; I almost want to call the flavor
more floral than spiced. The very light bite of bitterness will
definitely get your attention, but the subtle notes of lemon will
keep it.

The Moka Java is a great brew that offers a little something extra
for anyone looking for that extra element of interest on top of your
basic coffee flavors. **8.6**/10
